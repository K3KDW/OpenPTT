OpenPTT is hardware for PTT operations, nothing more. That said, audio is a critical part of the packet radio system. PTT is of no use without audio.

In a linux terminla, run the following:
$ aplay -l //This is the sound card OUTPUT information you'll need to configure Direwolf
$ arecord -r //This is the sound card INPUT information you'll need to configure Direwolf
$ direwolf
$ sudo alsamixer //Select the correct soundcard and adjust input volume as necessary until packet traffic in the Direwolf terminal averages around 50.
Hit the ESC key
$alsactl store //This stores the current settings. PLEASE NOTE: This setting is only accurate when the radio volume is unchanged.
